# Javascript Beginners Style Guide
When writing javascript, your "style" is very important for readable code. By style, we mean how you indent your code, where you add spaces, etc. Most often, this won't actually affect the code itself, but it will be very helpful in the long run. The following is a review of what we've already covered and best practices. Use it as a reference you can refer to when writing code in the future.

## Declaring Variables
When declaring variables, everything should be separated by a space.

```
var person = "aaron";
```
bad
```
var person="aaron";
```

bad
```
var person ="aaron"
```
