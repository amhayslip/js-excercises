# Javascript Beginners Style Guide
When writing javascript, your "style" is very important for readable code. By style, we mean how you indent your code, where you add spaces, etc. Most often, this won't actually affect the code itself, but it will be very helpful in the long run. The following is a review of what we've already covered and best practices. Use it as a reference you can refer to when writing code in the future.

## Declaring Variables
When declarding variables, we write <strong>var</strong> followed by a space, followed by whatever our variable is going to be called, followed by the <strong>=</strong> sign, followed by a space, followed by whatever we're assigning to the variable. Below are some good and bad examples.

good
```javascript
var person = "aaron";
```
<br>
bad
```javascript
var person="aaron";
```
<br>
bad
```javascript
var person ="aaron"
```
```javascript
var cities = []
```
